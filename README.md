# Gram-Schmidt Algorithm Implementation

## üìñ Introduction to the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm

The **Gram-Schmidt process** is a key algorithm in linear algebra used to convert a set of linearly independent vectors into an orthogonal or orthonormal set. This process is essential in various mathematical and computational applications, including:

- **Solving linear systems:** By forming orthogonal bases, it simplifies computations.
- **QR decomposition:** Often used in numerical methods for decomposing matrices.
- **Fourier series analysis:** Ensures orthogonality of basis functions.
- **Least squares regression:** Helps find the best fit in multidimensional spaces.

## üßÆ Mathematical Description 

Let's consider a set of vectors <b>{v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ, ..., v‚Çô}</b> in a Euclidean space. The Gram-Schmidt process transforms this set into an orthogonal set <b>{u‚ÇÅ, u‚ÇÇ, ..., u‚Çô}</b> and orthonormal set <b>{e‚ÇÅ, e‚ÇÇ, ..., e‚Çô}</b> using the following steps:  

1. **Start by setting** <b>u‚ÇÅ = v‚ÇÅ</b>.  

2. **For each subsequent vector** **v·µ¢** **(with i > 1)**, subtract the projection of **v·µ¢** onto all preceding vectors **u‚±º (with j < i)**, and set this result as **u·µ¢**. The projection of **v·µ¢** onto **u‚±º** can be found using the formula:

</p>
   where <b>"¬∑"</b> denotes the dot product. Thus, the formula for <b>u·µ¢</b> becomes:  </br>

</p>  

3. **To obtain an orthonormal basis, normalize each vector** **u·µ¢** by dividing it by its magnitude **|u·µ¢|**.
